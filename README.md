# tic-tac-toe
In this project I will showcase the skill I learned in the last lesson, namely Modular pattern, factory functions, scope and closures
1.Player click on input square, add input to gameBoard at right inder, disable the given checkbox
This project really taught me a lot about modules and factory function, structure of the code could be done alot better, but overall I am happy with the program I have made, next I have to work on the structure of my modules and functions as well as implement better logic, this project is not a portfolio project so I will leave it as is and maybe revisit it sometimes
